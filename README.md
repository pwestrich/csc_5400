To build and run this program, you first must install Rust. Instructions for that can be found [here.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/book/installing-rust.html)

Once you have the compiler and reposirtory, running is pretty easy. 

To run the program's unit tests in release mode: `cargo test --release`
To run the program in release mode: `cargo run --release`
To just build the program: `cargo build --release`

If you would prefer debug mode, remove the `--release` from any of the above commands.
